Meeting - 1/14/20 (3 hours)

We decided to make something similar to load store processor. We decided we want 16 registers and 16 different instructions, so we decided on a 4-bit opcode and 4-bit register addresses. We decided what 
we want each register’s purpose to be. We also decided which instructions we want.
