WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net RegWrite is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net control/ALUSrcB_not0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         451 out of   9,312    4%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          444
    Number used as Latches:               7
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,112 out of   9,312   22%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,232 out of   4,656   26%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,232 out of   1,232 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,232   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,169 out of   9,312   23%
    Number used as logic:             1,088
    Number used as a route-thru:         57
    Number used for 32x1 RAMs:        1,024
      (Two LUTs used per 32x1 RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 28 out of     232   12%
    IOB Latches:                          3
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                5.34

Peak Memory Usage:  4536 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  6 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   4 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.
